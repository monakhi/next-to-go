No adjustment in the weights but this fellow is seven runs into the prep and probably cannot improve. Still looks the biggest danger on current form. SEVEN'S (3) comes back in trip after failing over 1800m at Rosehill last time out. Cherry ripe after three runs back and this looks his right race. I'VE BEAN TRYIN' (1) bolted in at Kembla last time. The heavy track may have been flattering but he can also produce on top of the ground. Must be considered. HURSTVILLE ZAGREB (4) resumes and protects a 100% career top three strike rate. Sure to make his presence felt.",
